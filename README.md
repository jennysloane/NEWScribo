This repo contains the files to create the website above. The website includes materials from a workshop myself and Tehilla Ostrovsky taught to year 7-9 students from Newington College. The students came up with the name - NEW for Newington College and Scribo as it can be translated to 'translation/coding' in Latin.

In this series of workshops we introduce the programming language "R" and teach data manipulation, wrangling, and visualization. This course was taught completely online and we relied on RStudio Cloud to help with coding questions and troubleshooting.  

The goal of the workshop was to have the students form groups and come up with one research question they were interested in exploring and trying to answer for a "final project". After asking the students what topics they would be interested in researching, we provided them with two possible datasets: one on sports (an Olympics dataset) and one on climate change (average rainfall in Australia).

The groups came up with the following research questions:
- How has annual rainfall changed in different Australian cities over the past 20 years?
- Is there a correlation between age and performance for olympic players over different sports?
- Exploring the relationship between height and sport of Olympic athletes

We had an awesome time teaching these workshops to this group of students. The students were incredibly intereseted in learning to program and genuinely interested in answering their research questions. It was an absolute pleasure to teach them!
