# Research Question
What is the relationship between flipper length and bill length for the 3 penguin species?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length", y = "Flipper Length") +
  easy_text_size(15) # from ggeasy
```
